[spent a last sleepless night in Sanguinem]

They received as heartfelt a send-off as those whose hearts had long ceased to beat could give them.

Ferid's was the worst, in Mika's professional opinion.

"Want to see a magic finger trick?"

Mika channeled his energy into a cold glare. "<i>No.</i>" Had Ferid asked if he wanted to see a rewind of his family dying, this reaction would have been more fitting...oh well, anything concerning Ferid would receive the same amount of disgust.

"Aw, it would be such fun!"

"I already know that trick." Still glaring vehemently, he bent his thumb and placed a finger over it, creating the illusion of his finger being cut in half.

Ferid's gleeful smile could mean nothing good. "What a cute display! But I was thinking more like this-"

Mika was treated to an unfortunate demonstration of Ferid legitimately chopping off his finger and reattaching it.

Fortunately, the other farewells were more palatable.

[They had to pretend to be traumatized escapees - this was easy because they truly were traumatized, - and to be burning with hatred toward all vampires - this was a bit more difficult as Mika was sort of a vampire.]

So here they were. For years, Mika had imagined going above ground, maybe even finding other humans if he allowed himself to dream, but he had certainly not pictured it like this - [sporting | wearing | arriving with] a UV guard [made to look like | disguised as | mimicking a livestock wristband | around his wrist], fluffy hair arranged over pointed ears.

Nevertheless, a taste of freedom was more than welcome.

Krul had said she would deliver other supplies with her bat, Arukanu, once they were settled in.

"It's a one-person room, but we only have this one"

"Oh, no, it's fine. We'd rather stay together"

"Who are these kids?"

"Children from the Hyakuya [sect], [lieutenant] Guren."

Guren squinted at them for an intense second and a half. Then he huffed and ran his fingers through his hair. "Stupid prophecy was two days off." He went back down the hall, muttering confusedly to himself about the wrong number of brats and frostbite from waiting in the cold for hours.

"That [lieutenant] was so cool, too."

"I don't know, he acted kind of suspicious of us..."

-

"She did save your life."
