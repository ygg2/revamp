Yuu and Mika stared at the locked door. "There's gotta be something important behind that door..." they both thought.

"I see you trying to get in through that door." Said the purplette who walked, into the room. "I'm Shinoa Hiiragi from the Hiiiragi family. I can get you in!"

"Family..." thought Yuu. "Sweet" he said allowed.

"Why are you helping us? You dont even know us.", Mika in deep suspicion.

"Yes but I like to enable mischief." said Shinoa. She opened the passcode box  and hit a bunch of numbers too outragously quick and fastly for mika to keep track of even though he had super vampire sense.

"Huh?! Howd you know the code?" Yuu said.

"Because I'm the cutest one here, obviously! Actually its because am a hiiragii but never underestimate what you can get away with by being cute."

The door swung open and Mikas eyebrows narrowed when he caught listen of a few notes of a haunting, pretty, melody.

they walked in the long dank hallway with the music playing in the bg.

"hmmM THERE IS SOMETHIGN STRANGE ABOUT YOU." The violette said. Mika flinched and unconsciously brushed his hair was over his ears. "Oh no! Does she knoe I'm a vampiree?" He thought distressed. Shinoa smiles a big evil grin, "I knew it! You are shy"

*time skip brought to you by lack of content*

"Here we are!" Shinoa singsonged.

The piano in middle of the room had the keys going up and down and a music was playing from it. Yuu ran over in awed.

"A player piano?" said Mika.

"This is no ordinary player piano, it is demon possessed." answered Shinoa happily, the black hair boy was punching the keys in joy. "Luckily the piano and the spell circle contain the demon, so it is not dangerous as long as it stays here." Suddenly her orbs got dark and she lowered her voice. "Listen, I know your a vampire. Dont think your off the hook just because i spared your life this time.If you try anything then you'll go byebye." she said.

Mika was stunned. "I would never hurt Yuu-chan!" he replied honestly.

"Yeah yeah. I know how dangerous someone can be behind a innocent face." she said, then Yuu finished fake playing and They all left the room.
