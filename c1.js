Mika used the last of his strength to weakly shove Yuu. "Just go, you idiot! Now!"

At that moment, a short vampire with her pink hair tied up in pigtails appeared in the doorway. She immediately took notice of Ferid lying on the floor with a gun wound in his head. "Oh my. How did these children catch you by surprise? You're a seventh progenitor for crying out loud."

Ferid sat up and smiled smugly at her. "What a treat to be visited by our beloved Queen, Krul Tepes."

"My seraphs were among these children. If you have any explanation for your actions, now would be the time to start."

Desperately hoping the vampires were distracted, Yuu continued pulling Mika, who no longer had enough strength to resist. They moved inch by inch toward potential escape while the nobles threatened each other - something about seraphs and councils, but Yuu couldn't be bothered to pay attention, until Ferid dramatically left the room and the queen was free to direct her disdainful glare elsewhere.

"Now that that nuisance is dealt with..." Krul turned her attention toward the black haired boy who was trying and failing at subtly dragging a 90% dead boy out of Sanguinem. She used her vampiric speed to intercept them. "What do we have here?" She tilted her head, seeming to be contemplating something.

Yuu's grip on Mika's shirt got tighter. "Leave us alone!"

"I'm afraid I'd rather not. With a bit of my help, that boy is going to live." The queen bit her lip and leaned down toward the blond.

"Get away from him! We don't need your help! We-"

Yuu was knocked out by Krul to prevent him from screaming his head off at her. She then faced Mika. "Now, as for you, you will cease to be human, and become something superior."

And with that, she sealed his fate with a kiss.

Mika awoke to bright lights and piercing silence.

Usually when he first woke up, his surroundings were somewhat blurry, but this time everything was sharp, too sharp. The stairs which must have been several meters away appeared as clearly as if they were at an arm's length, and this change in his depth perception was almost dizzying. He tried to focus in on any sound instead, but there was not even breathing and the complete lack of noise made his head hurt nearly as much as his parched throat.

Wait, but hadn't he died.

Besides, wasn't he in so much more pain before? He could remember it entirely, but now he felt better, maybe even better than ever in some ways.

"Finally, you're conscious."

Mika winced at the high voice suddenly breaking the silence. He sat up to see that he had been lying on the red carpet of a large room.

Krul was sitting on a throne at the top of the stairs, leaning majestically to one side. "I requested you to be brought here once the first part of your transformation was complete."

"Transformation...?"

Krul picked up a cup from her armrest and Mika watched the red liquid inside slosh tantalizingly.

Then it hit him. The reason he could easily see the drink from such a distance, why neither of them was breathing by default, why he was so incredibly thirsty.

He was not dead.

He was worse than dead.

"Come on, Mika. Just drink this blood." Krul tilted the cup back and forth, and Mika involuntarily took a sharp breath, his eyes following the movement like a cat watching a feather toy. Krul hummed. "Accept that this is your life now and I promise you you'll start feeling better. You'll become a complete vampire with an immortal body and strength far beyond that of a human."

Now, Mika's last memory came flooding back. His family? slaughtered. Yuu? incapacitated. Vampire blood? forced into his mouth...Everything started falling into place and Mika leapt to his feet. "Yuu-chan! Where is he?"

Krul blinked. "Recovering. Humans are fragile, and he took quite a hit to the head. Don't worry, I have use for him yet." She stood and began approaching him, still holding the cup. "But that's not of importance now. You need to drink this human blood."

Mika didn't know if her words made him relieved or more worried, but as much as he craved to know Yuu was okay, his body craved something else. This was made worse by the fact that Krul was currently bringing it to him. "No. No way! I refuse."

She giggled. "Why do you fight it? Give your body what it desires."

"I'd rather die as a human than live as a vampire!"

Krul gave an exaggerated sigh, basically pouting. "I suspected this might happen. But if you don't drink blood, you can't die normally. You'll become a hideous demon."

Mika trembled, but didn't respond, fighting the instincts that told him to grab the cup and take a sip.

"Perhaps you need more persuasion."

Just then, there was a knock on the door and Krul looked over. "Perfect timing, actually. You may enter!"

One of the tall doors was opened by a vampire in uniform and a small figure was led into the room. It was Yuu with a distinct lack of livestock collar, and eerily calm. At first, Mika's heart soared to know the other was okay, but he was drawn suddenly to the bare skin of Yuu's neck and his breath caught in his dry, aching throat. "I..."

"They told me I can save you if I give you my blood." Yuu raised his gaze from the floor and stared into Mika's eyes bravely.

Mika took a step back and shook his head, distressed. "Never. I won't do it!"

"Mika! You can't starve yourself. Or I'll...I'll-!" He couldn't think of what to say. "I almost lost you once already!"

"Look at me, Yuu-chan! I'm already becoming a monster. How could you say..." Mika clenched his fists weakly as if trying to hold onto the little humanity he had left. "Please. Don't ask me to do this."

"Hmm...an interesting development." Pondering the situation, Krul rested her head on the back of her hand. "A semi-vampire who wishes to remain so, and a human who would do anything for him..." She turned back to face the newly sired vampire again. "So, you desire to live among humans without consuming their blood? I suppose that could be arranged."

The two boys' wide eyes were on her in a split second.

"How would the both of you like to become my spies?"`}
