They received as heartfelt a send-off as those whose hearts had long stopped could give them.

Ferid's was the worst, in Mika's professional opinion.

"Want to see a magic finger trick?"

Mika channeled all his energy into a glare. "No." Had Ferid asked if he wanted to see a rewind of his family dying, Mika's reaction would have been more fitting...oh well, anything concerning Ferid would receive the same amount of disgust.

"Aw, it would be such fun!"

"I already know it." He bent his thumb and placed a finger over it to create the illusion of his finger being cut in two.

Guren squinted at them for an intense second and a half. Then he huffed and ran his fingers through his hair. "Stupid prophecy was two days off." He went back down the hall, muttering confusedly to himself about the wrong number of brats and frostbite from waiting in the cold for hours.

"That [lieutenant] was so cool, too."

"I don't know, he acted kind of suspicious of us..."

-

"She did save your life."
