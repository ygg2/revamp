content: `[ Mika heats his blood in the kitchen. Someone is coming so he dumps it in a fountain drink cup and runs. Guren finds him running and calls him in for "a talk" (questioning). ]

"Are you sure the drink is punch?"

Mika nodded carefully though he felt worried. He swallowed, still craving the blood.

"You got punch!" Yuu had just barged into the room and his eyes sparkled. He snatched the cup from where Guren had recently placed it back.

"Wait no Yuu-chan-" Mika lunged for it, but Yuu already was sipping the red liquid.

Yuu coughed and made a face. "Mika, this-" He paused because he saw Mika's terrified expression.

The metaphorical gears in Mika's head were spinning doubly fast. "So! If that's all you wanted to ask, we'll just...get going here!" He stumbled over his words and also over his feet in his attempt to exit the room, Yuu's hand firmly in his grasp.

In the hallway, Mika frantically looked around for the nearest bathroom for Yuu to spit out the blood, but said boy suddenly grabbing his arm stopped him. Yuu's face was pale. "Mika, I feel..."

Mika's throat seemed dry but not from lack of blood. This couldn't be happening. "Yuu-chan...you didn't already...<i>swallow</i> any, did you?"

"Just a little!" He swayed slightly in place.

For a second, Mika reviewed his entire existence. "Yuu-chan?"

"Yeah?"

"We need to get you to our room, now."

He helped Yuu who leaned stumbling.

[Mika manages to get Yuu in but before Yuu starts screaming. He buries Yuu in pillows (Vamps don't need to breathe and he needs to stifle the screams)]

In a panic, Mika smothered Yuu in blankets. Vampires didn't need to breathe so it would be fine.

[But the glass break alarm goes off]

[Mika rushes into the hall with a lamp and throws it on the floor. He starts crying. People show up and take Mika to get cleaned up. They ignore the music in the room. Mika's cut heals too fast so he's like "Guess small cuts can bleed a lot" he crushed the lamp before throwing it.]

"I...wanted to get it replaced, but..."

Mika returned to the room as quickly as he could without causing suspicion. Inside, he shut the door and flopped down on the bed. The adrenaline now disappearing, Mika felt the weight of what was happening crashing down on him. Yuu-chan was going to become a monster, too...

Real tears started to prick at his eyes and he wrapped his arms around the trembling bundle of blankets "I'm sorry, Yuu-chan"`}
